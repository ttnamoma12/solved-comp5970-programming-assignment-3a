<strong>For this assignment you will develop a single-view application with a picker, a text field and three buttons. The single-component picker from the example application for this chapter would not be a bad place to start. The data for the picker is initially three items: Each item is a string</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Thing One</li>

 <li>Thing Two</li>

 <li>Thing Three</li>

</ul>

When you press the “select button, the item from the picker that is selected should be displayed in an alert, like the example application. The other two buttons are labeled “replace” and “insert”. When you press the “replace” button, the item selected in the picker should be replaced by the contents of the text field (blank if nothing in the text field). When you press “insert”, the contents of the text field should be added to the data for the picker, after the item currently selected, and the new, added, item should be shown in the picker as the selected item (so the previously selected item would be immediately above it on the picker’s display at that point).
